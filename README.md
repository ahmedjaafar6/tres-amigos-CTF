# tres-amigos-CTF

## Description
There are three parts. Solve one part to move on to the next. Each part will have its own flag. The flags are needed to move on to the next part. The final part's flag is the final flag that will be the challenge's solution. The first part deals with a file, destination.txt. get_password.c is used to test if your password guess is correct. Make sure you use the class's Kali-Linux VM since I made sure everything works there. On other machines some stuff you try may not work, I know because I tried.

## How to Run
All you need to do is run "run.sh". That bash script will run all of the parts back to back. In order to check your password guesses, "get_password" needs to be run by you.

## Solution
Check the "solution" folder for the solution. Check "docker/meta.yml" for hints. 

## Docker
A Docker image was also made for this CTF. If you want to run it inside Docker, just run "Dockerfile". Ignore the docker-compose.yml file, it's broken right now, working on fixing it.
